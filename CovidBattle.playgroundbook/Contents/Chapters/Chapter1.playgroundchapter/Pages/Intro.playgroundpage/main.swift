# Welcome!

 Hello recruit. Like me, you must be doing social distance and using measures to keep yourself safe, wearing mask and washing your hands with soap and water or hand sanitizer.

Covid 19 is a virus that has been affecting the entire globe. In most cases, its symptoms are light, and it may look like a stronger flu, but in some cases it can lead to severe symptoms that require more invasive procedures such as mechanical ventilation, in addition to leading to death. Its greatest danger and itself does not come from the symptoms, but the speed with which the virus spreads and the lack of a known treatment.

After 3 months of its discovery, the presence of the virus was confirmed in 118 countries and in 2021 it is already present in 182 countries. We need to do something to prevent hospitals from becoming overcrowded in our city and thus have vacancies for everyone who needs medical treatment.

Recruit, today is your first day of work and we thank you for taking the risk to help the population. Now that you know a little more about what we are going to face, itâ€™s time to move to the next page where I will explain what I should do.
